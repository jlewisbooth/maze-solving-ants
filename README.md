# Maze Solving Ants

This uses a fairly straightforward approach to solving the shortest solution of a maze using Ant Colony Optimisation.

This also includes an approach to generate random NxM mazes using Kruskals algorithm. It creates fairly good mazes! Ones that these ants can solve anyway.

This project uses CMake to compile, please use Cmake to make the compiling stage easier, or try to imitate what the CMakeLists.txt files are trying to achieve.
